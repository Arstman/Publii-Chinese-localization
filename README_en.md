## Improve translation


Please help me improve the quality of translation! Currently maintaining a Chinese translation at Crowdin, you can join the translation via [ Invitation Link ](https://crwd.in/publii-chinese-localization ) .



## Installation

Publii supported the installation of the language pack in 0.39.0, but it is experimental so it is not marked, only in their update blog [ mentioned ](https://getpublii.com/blog/release-039.html ) , as shown in the following GIF, download the latest version of Release.

## Why are some positions still in English?

- proper nouns are retained in the original language

- the site theme is in the form of a separate installation package and can not be integrated into the language pack

- limited ability to come up with a suitable translation for the time being
